abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) have revolutionized the field of advanced robotics in recent years. AI, ML, and DL are transforming the field of advanced robotics, making robots more intelligent, efficient, and adaptable to complex tasks and environments. Some of the applications of AI, ML, and DL in advanced robotics include autonomous navigation, object recognition and manipulation, natural language processing, and predictive maintenance. These technologies are also being used in the development of collaborative robots (cobots) that can work alongside humans and adapt to changing environments and tasks. The AI, ML, and DL can be used in advanced transportation systems in order to provide safety, efficiency, and convenience to the passengers and transportation companies . Also, the AI, ML, and DL are playing a critical role in the advancement of manufacturing assembly robots, enabling them to work more efficiently, safely, and intelligently. Furthermore, they have a wide range of applications in aviation management, helping airlines to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction. Moreover, the AI, ML, and DL can help taxi companies in order to provide better, more efficient, and safer services to customers. The research presents an overview of current developments in AI, ML, and DL in advanced robotics systems and discusses various applications of the systems in robot modification. Further research works regarding the applications of AI, ML, and DL in advanced robotics systems are also suggested in order to fill the gaps between the existing studies and published papers. By reviewing the applications of AI, ML, and DL in advanced robotics systems, it is possible to investigate and modify the performances of advanced robots in various applications in order to enhance productivity in advanced robotic industries.}

abstract = {Teach and Repeat (T&R) refers to the technology that allows a robot to autonomously follow a previously traversed route, in a natural scene and using only its onboard sensors. In this paper we present a Visual-Inertial Teach and Repeat (VI-T&R) algorithm that uses stereo and inertial data and targets Unmanned Aerial Vehicles with limited on-board computational resources. We propose a tightly-coupled relative formulation of the visual-inertial constraints that is tailored to the T&R application. In order to achieve real-time operation on limited hardware, we reduce the problem to motion-only visual-inertial Bundle Adjustment. In the repeat stage, we detail how to generate a trajectory and smoothly follow it with a constantly changing relative frame. The proposed method is validated in simulated environments, using real sensor data from the public EuRoC dataset, and using our own robotic setup and closed-loop control. Our experimental results demonstrate high accuracy and real-time performance both on a standard desktop system and on a low-cost Odroid X-U4 embedded computer.}
